# Abundant Life Service Introductions

This site is used to create simple presentation that continually cycles through, to display information during the announcements or before service

### Play Button
This button is located at the bottom of the menu, and it plays the presentation.

### Pause button
This button is located at the top right of the screen during the presentation. This button stops the presentation and bring the user back to the menu.

### Import button
This button allows the user to bring in projects they have made with this site. 

### Project Name
This text field allows the user to name the project

### download button
The site automatically saves all text, but does not save pictures uploaded by the user. So in order for the user to save a project that includes user submitted pictures, they must use the download button and save the project to their computer, to bring in later.

This button allows the user to download the current project as a text file.



## Text Settings

This is the main screen for adding text and media to the project. the menu options allow the user to input text, and change its color, size, font, animation and duration on screen. This menu also allows adding pictures and videos with the media button. Media menu options allow the user to preview the media, change its animation, and duration, and mute or loop videos. After inputing text or media, the user presses the submit button, which adds the text/media to the list below

### Text Settings List

This list holds all the text/media that the user submits.
It has menu options to allow the user to change aspects of the text/media or to insert a new text/media , or delete instead.
The items in this list are able to be dragged and dropped into different positions. It is best for the user to drag starting from the top of the item.

## Timer Settings

This menu is similar to the Text settings, allowing the user to manipulate text only. It has the option to display a countdown timer set by the user. This timer is displayed after all the items in the text screen list have already been displayed on the screen. It is able to be toggled ON and OFF. There is a preview that plays whenever the user changes a field

## Theme Settings

This menu allows the user to set a background picture or video that continously displayed throughout the presentation. The user can pick between preset images or the user can choose their own images/videos from their computer. If selecting videos, the user has the option to have the video play while muted, with the mute button

## Screen
This is where the presentation is played. It starts in fullscreen mode, but the user can press ESC to exit that mode. The user can click on the right side of the screen to skip to the next slide in the presentation, and click on the left side to go back a slide.
